# Snakes and Ladders Game
This was my first programming project, in the first year of my Bachelor's degree, in the subject Computer Science Basics. It consisted of implementing the game _Snakes and Ladders_ in java using BlueJ, a free Java Development Environment.

The game is played on a game board with numbered, gridded squares. A number of _Ladders_ and _Snakes_ are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the end (top square), helped by climbing Ladders but hindered by falling down Snakes.

This particular project had 2 players and the game board consisted of: 100 squares and 2 snakes and 2 ladders set by the user, although there was also the option to configure them randomly by the program. The program gives all the necessary information to know the state of the game all the time and the die is rolled with the ``enter`` key.

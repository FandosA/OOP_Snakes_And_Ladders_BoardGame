# Snakes_and_Ladders_Game
This was my first programming project, in the first year of my Bachelor's degree, in the subject Computer Science Basics. It consisted of implemneting the game "Snakes and ladders" in java using BlueJ, a free Java Development Environment.

The game is played on a game board with numbered, gridded squares. A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped by climbing ladders but hindered by falling down snakes.

This particular project had 2 players, the game board consisted of 100 squares, there were 2 snakes and 2 ladders and the program asked the user in which square each of them started and ended. The program gives all the necessary information to know the state of the game all the time.
